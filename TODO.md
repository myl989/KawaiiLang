Short-term todo:
* Let functions take objects as input/output
* Allow use of super and this in constructor
* Auto-write default constructor

Long-term todo:
* More built-in functions!!! More!!!!!!
* GUI API (if Processing did it, so can I)
* Dictionaries and sets
* Matrixes?
* List generics
* Allow proper unload/reloading of include statements
* Type inference?
* Break a specific loop instead of breaking the whole thing
* Object orientated programming?
* Function kwargs?
* Auto deletion of variables out of scope?

Bugs (high priority):
N/A

Bugs (low priority):
* Null pointers hangs the program
* Incompatable variable type declaration and contents are not detected until variable is used
