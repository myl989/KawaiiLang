Todo:
* Fill in places with `//error`
* Switch statements for `Numwer`s
* Bitwise operators
* Lists with type restrictions?
* Matrixes?
* Type infrence?
* Get list length
* Error output when running files
* Get type of variable
* Some built-in functions to actually make it more usable, including print
* Object orientated programming?
* Compiler?
* Auto deletion of variables out of scope?

Bugs (high priority):
N/A

Bugs (low priority):
* The line number in errors is often not correct as the line incrementer of Position class is weird
* Frequent unchecked null pointers in variable declaration and assignment code
* Null pointers hangs the program
* Incompatable variable type declaration and contents are not detected until variable is used
