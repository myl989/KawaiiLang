Todo:
* Using functions as variables (i.e. `def useFunc(Func f): return f()`)

Bugs (high priority):
N/A

Bugs (low priority):
* Single lines of code with multiple `!`s do not work
* The line number in errors is often not correct as the line incrementer of Position class is weird
* Null pointers hangs the program
* Auto-delete variables outside scope perhaps...?
* Incompatable variable type declaration and contents are not detected until variable is used
