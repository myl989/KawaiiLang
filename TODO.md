Todo:
* More operators (comparison, logical, etc.)
* Allow variables to be set to "nwthin"
* Allow updating variables (e.g. +=, ++. etc)

Bugs:
* Single lines of code with multiple !s do not work
* The line number in errors is often not correct as the line incrementer of Position class is weird
* Nested `^_^ewndNotice` closes the whole thing rather than just one if statement
