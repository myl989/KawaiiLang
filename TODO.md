Todo:
* Call or change loop index within loop
* Break statement for loop

Bugs (high priority):
* Statements like `^_^wepeatDat` and `^_^ewndNotice` arn't run if placed after `stawp` statements.

Bugs (low priority):
* Single lines of code with multiple `!`s do not work
* The line number in errors is often not correct as the line incrementer of Position class is weird
