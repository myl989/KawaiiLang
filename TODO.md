Todo:
* Allow user to call or change loop index within loop

Bugs (high priority):
* In this statement:
```
Numwer a iws 0!
do 100 twimes!
  OwO *notices a <_< 10*?
    a iws a awdd 1!
  ^_^ewndNotice!
  ewlse!
  OwO *notices :>*?
    stawp!
  ^_^ewndNotice!
^_^wepeatDat!
```
  The else statemnt doesn't work

Bugs (low priority):
* Single lines of code with multiple `!`s do not work
* The line number in errors is often not correct as the line incrementer of Position class is weird
