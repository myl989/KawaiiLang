Todo:
* Switch statements for `Numwer`s
* Arrays
* Type classes (get type of variable)
* Some built-in functions to actually make it more usable, including print
* Object orientated programming?
* Compiler?

Bugs (high priority):
N/A

Bugs (low priority):
* The line number in errors is often not correct as the line incrementer of Position class is weird
* Null pointers hangs the program
* Auto-delete variables outside scope perhaps...?
* Incompatable variable type declaration and contents are not detected until variable is used
