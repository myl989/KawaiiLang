So, this is my attempt at making a "Kawaii" programming language with... lots of UwU and OwO faces. I know this has been done (to varying degrees) before, and this project probably won't be the most practical, but... I've got too much time to spare anyways.

Currently status: Lexer (albeit a rudimentary one), Parser to be done

Current features: Integers, floating-points, add, subtract, multiply, and divide operations.

Will make documentation in the future.
