So, this is my attempt at making a "Kawaii" programming language with... lots of UwU and OwO faces. I know this is kind of silly, and it has been done (to varying degrees) before, and this project probably won't even be the very practical, but... I've got too much time to spare anyways.

Currently status: Lexer (albeit a rudimentary one), Parser to be done

Current features: Integers, floating-points, add, subtract, multiply, and divide operations.

Will make documentation in the future.
