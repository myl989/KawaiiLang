So, this is my attempt at making a "Kawaii" esoteric programming language featuring... UwU and OwO faces. I know this is kind of silly, and it has been done (to varying degrees) before, and this project probably won't even be the very practical, but... I've got too much time to spare anyways.

DISCLAIMER: This whole thing is meant a joke. But... you can use it for regular coding too if you really want to.

Currently status: Lexer (albeit a rudimentary one), Parser to be done

Current features: Integers, floating-points, add, subtract, multiply, and divide operations.

Will make documentation in the future.
