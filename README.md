<h1>Have you gotten sick and tired of normal programming language syntax? Have you ever wanted to code like your favourite anime girl or guy?</h1> 

(Probably not, but screw it I'm making this anyways.) 

So, this is my attempt at making a "Kawaii" esoteric programming language featuring... UwU and OwO faces. 
I know this is kind of silly, and it has been done (to varying degrees) before, and this project probably won't even be the very practical, but... I've got too much time to spare anyways. (I might look at this in the future with dissappointment)

**DISCLAIMER: This whole thing is meant as a joke.** But... you can use it for regular coding too if you really want to.

Currently status: Interpreter works for calculations with the following operations

Current features: Integers, floating-points, add, subtract, multiply, divide, parenthesis, and modular arithmatic operations. Variable assignment and use, as well as variable deletion.

Will make documentation in the future.
